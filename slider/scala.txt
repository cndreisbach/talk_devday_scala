# What's Scala?

* Created in 2001 by Martin Odersky
* Runs on the JVM
* Everything's an object
* But it's a functional language
* Compiled beforehand or just-in-time
* Static typing with inference
* Actor-based concurrency

---

# Hello world

<% highlight 'scala' do %>
object HelloWorld extends Application {
  println("Hello world")
}
<% end %>

## Java-style

<% highlight 'scala' do %>
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Hello world")
  }
}
<% end %>

# Why am I interested in Scala?

## I'm a Javan:

* Scala classes are Java classes. Scala's just another Java library as far as the JVM's concerned.
* I like functional programming and want to use it.
* I want something more high-level, but don't want to sacrifice speed or static typing.
* Writing concurrent Java code makes me want to break albums of Beethoven
across the back of the john

# Why am I interested in Scala?

## I'm a Rubyist:

* I want something fast to write parts of my code in, but I don't want to sacrifice readability or dynamism.
* I need to write some concurrent code and
  * I want some actual threads
  * I want to not scream
* By definition, I'm a developer that likes emerging technologies, and I want to learn something new

# What is different about Scala?

Most of Scala isn't jarring.

* No class or static attributes or methods
* No obvious constructors
* Syntax is close to what you're used to, but not close enough
* Relies on another language (Java) for much of its standard library

# Type inference

<%= highlight example('CSVLine.scala') %>

---

# To make my own slideshow program

* Textile or Markdown (Xilize)
* Templating (http://www.familie-kneissl.org/Members/martin/blog/a-scala-wrapper-for-apache-velocity/view)
* Syntax highlighting (use JavaScript?)
* Option parser
